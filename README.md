# Kat's Crystal Game

## A numbers counting game using Javascript, HTML and CSS

### You will be given a random target number at the start of the game. Each crystal below is worth a certain amount. Click them to collect their amount. You win if you can match your number to the target number. You loose if you go over the target number amount. Each crystal's worth will be reset at the begining of each new game.
